Introduction
With the growing demand for smartphones in India, online marketplaces like Flipkart have become key platforms for both consumers and manufacturers. Understanding product distribution, pricing strategies, and consumer preferences can provide valuable business insights.
This project involves analyzing real-world scraped data of mobile phones listed on Flipkart to uncover trends in pricing, brand performance, and commonly offered specifications. By creating an interactive Tableau dashboard, the goal is to visually present these insights to assist stakeholders in making data-driven decisions regarding market strategies and product positioning.

Recommendations
To address the project objectives, the following strategies were implemented:
Data Cleaning & Integration: Combined and deduplicated data from multiple sources, handled missing values, and created a unified dataset for analysis.
Price Segmentation: Defined low, mid, and premium price ranges to categorize mobile products meaningfully.
Interactive Dashboard Creation: Built a Tableau dashboard with visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, heatmaps, and scatter plots to uncover patterns in brand offerings, specifications, and customer ratings.

Key Recommendations:
Brands should focus on 4GB–6GB RAM and 64GB–128GB storage models, which are most in demand.
Underrepresented segments (like premium or low-end) offer growth opportunities for brands currently limited to one price tier.
Samsung and Xiaomi lead in product variety, and other brands can study their strategies to improve visibility.
